Social Web3 Network

Welcome to the Social Web3 Network repository, where we're building the next generation of social networking platforms integrated with Web3 technologies. Our platform is designed to reward active users with tokens, incentivizing engagement and content creation within a privacy-conscious environment.

Project Overview
Social Web3 Network aims to redefine online social interactions by leveraging blockchain technology to reward users for their contributions and engagement. Unlike traditional social networks, our platform ensures user privacy and data protection, allowing users to consent to the tracking of their personally identifiable information (PI) in exchange for rewards.

Key Features
Token Rewards: Earn tokens for activities such as posting content, engaging with others, and contributing to the community.
Privacy-Centric: Opt-in tracking of PI with a focus on user consent and data protection.
Decentralized Identity: Users control their data through blockchain-based identities.
Community Governance: Token holders can participate in decision-making processes, influencing the platform's development and policies.
Technology Stack
Frontend: React.js, Web3.js
Backend: Django (Python), Node.js for smart contracts
Blockchain: Ethereum for token rewards and smart contracts
Database: PostgreSQL
